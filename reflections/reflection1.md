## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

One successful thing is that we were able to pull off our learning center feature, and this was probably the biggest component we were worried about, but it came along very nicely thanks to dividing and conquering the workload between the pod.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges we faced as a group were organization and design. Specifically we kept coming back to the drawing board on our Figma and redesigning some pages, and this led to losing some time, but overall everything came out really nice and clean, so it paid off in the end.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to finish all of the tasks in our sprint plan, and we were able to finish most of, if not all of Sprint 2.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Looking back on Jeff Astor's videos were a tremendous help, and especially some of our previous projects. This helped us because we didn't have to reinvent the wheel when making some certain components, an example of this is that Travis recreated a filter button, just like in the student store project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

One feature is possibly the home page, since there's a limit on the amount of requests we can make to that API, it could certainly put that part of our website on hold and become non-functioning. Some solutions we can implement are caching data, or upgrading our license so that we can have access to a higher limit of api requests.
