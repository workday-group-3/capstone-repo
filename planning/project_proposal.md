## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

Referee's Handbook - All in one guide to learning a new sport for fans, so that they can carry a conversation amongst friends or be able to understand the rules of a game while watching. Target audience is for people who want to get into watching a new sport.





## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

Referee's Handbook - A website where beginners could learn the rules and history of any sport, how it's played, and common terms so that you could follow along watching any game and join in conversation among your friends. Added features can be stats and details about collegiate, amateur, and professional teams, statistics for each player, and the history of each team. Lastly, a fantasy league component could be added, or a recent events page where you can see that team's upcoming games and who they're against.

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?


The Referee's Handbook is similar to a  of Khan Academy for sports, so that user's are able to learn new things and there will be statistics for teams and players. The Referee's Handbook is a combination of learning and user engagement with statistics and fantasy league stretch features, so that it will draw in a bigger target audience, rather than just newer fans.


## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?



A question we have is about dividing the work and splitting our efforts between the frontend, backend, and what the design phase will look like in the coming weeks.
Some questions still remain about which APIs we could utilize for the app, and finalizing what our minimum viable product will look like  and separating core features from strech features.
