# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Travis Navarro, Aileen Ji, Ernesto Enriquez

## Problem Statement

Insert your groups problem statement and target audience.

Referee's Handbook - All in one guide to learning a new sport for fans, so that they can carry a conversation amongst friends or be able to understand the rules of a game while watching. Target audience is for people who want to get into watching a new sport.


Game Recommendation Website - A website that provides game recommendations according to personality/preferences to both new and old gamers, helps them discover games they might like. Target audience is gamers (new and old).


## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

Referee's Handbook - A website where beginners could learn the rules and history of any sport, how it's played, and common terms so that you could follow along watching any game and join in conversation among your friends. Added features can be stats and details about collegiate, amateur, and professional teams, statistics for each player, and the history of each team. Lastly, a fantasy league component could be added, or a recent events page where you can see that team's upcoming games and who they're against.

Game Recommendation Website -  Allows the user to do a survey and provides a list of game recommendations. Can do interesting filters such as "People with this mbti/in this location like this type of game...". Also shows what platforms the game is available on. A stretch feature would be also acting as a second hand game/game console reselling site. The MVP would be similar to the flixster website, allowing the user to discover games, search and filter.

Discovery page/deals page
Match search/filtering page

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

The game recommendation website has some of the same concepts as the Flixster app, in terms of a main feed and discovery page, also being able to filter out and search for specific things. A feat

The Referee's Handbook is similar to a  of Khan Academy for sports, so that user's are able to learn new things and there will be statistics for teams and players. The Referee's Handbook is a combination of learning and user engagement with statistics and fantasy league stretch features, so that it will draw in a bigger target audience, rather than just newer fans.


## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?


The biggest question we have is picking between the two app ideas.
A question we have is about dividing the work and splitting our efforts between the frontend, backend, and what the design phase will look like in the coming weeks.
Some questions still remain about which APIs we could utilize between the two app ideas, and finalizing what our minimum viable product will look like for each and separating core features from strech features.
